//We can’t implement external traits on external types. For example, we can’t implement the Display trait on Vec<T> within our own crate, because Display and Vec<T> are defined in the standard library and aren’t local to our crate.
//This restriction is often called the orphan rule, so named because the parent type is not present. This rule ensures that other people’s code can’t break your code and vice versa.
//It’s possible to get around this restriction using the newtype pattern, which involves creating a new type in a tuple struct.
