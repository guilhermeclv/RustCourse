//When we use trait bounds on generics, the compiler generates nongeneric implementations of functions and methods for each concrete type that we use in place of a generic type parameter. The code that results from monomorphization is doing static dispatch, which is when the compiler knows what method you’re calling at compile time.
//When we use trait objects, Rust must use dynamic dispatch. The compiler doesn’t know all the types that might be used with the code that is using trait objects, so it doesn’t know which method implemented on which type to call. Instead, at runtime, Rust uses the pointers inside the trait object to know which method to call. There is a runtime cost when this lookup happens that doesn’t occur with static dispatch. Dynamic dispatch also prevents the compiler from choosing to inline a method’s code, which in turn prevents some optimizations.
//However, we do get extra flexibility when using dynamic dispatch.
trait Foo {
    fn method(&self) -> String;
}

impl Foo for u8 {
    fn method(&self) -> String { format!("u8: {}", *self) }
}

impl Foo for String {
    fn method(&self) -> String { format!("string: {}", *self) }
}

// IMPLEMENT below with generics.
fn static_dispatch<T: Foo>(x: T) {
    println!("{}", x.method());
}

// Implement below with trait objects.
fn dynamic_dispatch(x: &dyn Foo) {
    println!("{}", x.method());
}

fn main() {
    let x = 5u8;
    let y = "Hello".to_string();

    static_dispatch(x);
    dynamic_dispatch(&y);

    println!("Success!");
