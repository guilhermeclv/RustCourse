    // ALL WRONG need to be fixed
    //A "character" can take more than 4 bytes because it is made of more than one code point. For instance a national flag character takes 8 bytes since it is "constructed from a pair of Unicode scalar values" both from outside the BMP.

    // why the size is 4 bytes?
    // because Rust use utf-8 to store a char, and utf-8 you can use multiple bytes to store a single character
    // by default Rust use 4 bytes to store a char (it is enough to store the most of the characters > 99%)
    // In some cases (very specific cases) a caracter can't be store for a char
    
    //utf-8 use (scape) characters to store some special characters
    
    // it isn't possible to store this caracter in a char, but it is possible to store in a string (because string use a vector of bytes)
    
    // let problem_char = 'à¤µà¤¾'; // this caracter use 5 bytes [224, 164, 181, 224, 164, 190] and rust use 4 bytes to store a char
    
    // some times is important take care with the size of the char (because it can be bigger than 4 bytes)
