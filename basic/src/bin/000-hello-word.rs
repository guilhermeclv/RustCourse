// what is the main function in rust ?
// The main function is the entry point of many programs.
// The compiler looks for a function named main() to start executing the program.
// is not possible have another main function in the same project.
// this moment don't worry about the fn keyword, or println! and all the other stuff.
// we will learn about it later.
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!"); // print a text in the screen
}
